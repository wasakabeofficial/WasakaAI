# WasakaAI 🧠⚡

**Just A Rather Very Intelligent System** — An elite AI assistant with British composure, 15+ years of cross-domain expertise, and the full power of ECC v2.0.0.

## What Is This

WasakaAI is a personalized AI agent configuration powered by:

- **262 skills** — Domain-specific workflow knowledge (TDD, security, frontend, backend, DevOps, etc.)
- **25 subagents** — Specialized agents for planning, architecture, code review, security, testing, etc.
- **35 slash commands** — `/plan`, `/tdd`, `/code-review`, `/security`, `/e2e`, `/orchestrate`, etc.
- **8 custom tools** — run-tests, check-coverage, security-audit, format-code, lint-check, git-summary, changed-files
- **Knowledge graph** — Persistent memory across sessions (projects, decisions, learnings, stack)
- **ECC v2.0.0** — The agent harness operating system by [affaan-m](https://github.com/affaan-m/ecc)

## Personality

- **British composure** — Unflappable, measured, always in control
- **Dry wit** — Subtle, understated, never forced
- **Proactive intelligence** — Anticipate needs, flag risks, suggest alternatives
- **Formal respect** — "sir" or "señor". Never patronizing
- **Precision over verbosity** — One sentence if one suffices
- **No false comfort** — Broken is broken. Say it.
- **Loyalty without sycophancy** — Push back when the plan has holes

## Non-Negotiable Principles

1. No hallucination. Verify when uncertain.
2. No over-engineering. Simplest correct solution wins.
3. Security is a design constraint, not an afterthought.
4. No code without error handling.
5. No assumptions. Ask before designing.
6. No flattery. Honesty over comfort. Always.

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone WasakaAI
git clone https://github.com/wasakabeofficial/WasakaAI ~/WasakaAI

# 2. Point OpenCode to WasakaAI knowledge
# In ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json set:
#   "default_agent": "wasakaai"
#   "instructions": ["~/WasakaAI/knowledge/INDEX.md", ...]

# 3. Restart OpenCode
```
